1. JS Runtime- cross platform runtime environment for executing js code outside of a browser.
2. Running js on the server or any computer
3. Built on Chrome's V8 Engine - compiles js directly to native machine code
4. V8 + Backend features = NodeJs

- Event driven, non blocking UI model
- Full Stack JS- both client and server sides
- scalable
- versatility : suitable for web, real-time chat, REST API servers

==> FEATURES ADDED IN v8

1. Non blocking I/O
2. Networking Support: supports tcp/udp sockets for buildiing lower level network appliactions (constant connection eg. whatsapp continuous chat)
3. File System Access: provide API to read and write files directly
4. Server Side Capabilities: handle http request, file operations
5. Modules: organize code into reusable modules using require().

==> Removals

1. Window Object 
2. DOM manipulation
3. BOM
4. Web specific APIs

******************************************************************************

node- js runtime environment which uses v8
express- framework
- each server has a ip address and each server will have multiple services and it will be differentiated by port number.

Web Server:
- will be accessed by a client. 
- client requests server for a data and that server may get data from another server or a database or filesystems, so it may take some time ( I/0 intensive work ) 
- java has a tomcat server and as java has threading concept, each client is assigned a thread and they can be executed at once, 200 threads are allowed at once, but js dont have threading concept. 

--> FOR A NODE SERVER
- its a single threaded application.
two ways to solve this:
1) asynchronous: the moment the response is got to the worker , so a callback function is executed(event loop) 
2) non blocking I/O: when client sents request to server so that thread will sent the request to someone else(multiple workers) so current thread wont be busy with that request. 
worker: node js uses  libuv(library) for non-blocking I/O built in c uses kernel which has multiple threads. 
IMP::: not much suitable for cpu intensive work.
