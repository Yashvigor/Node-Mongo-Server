mongod – the main MongoDB server daemon. It handles connections,
database storage, and queries. You must run this before using MongoDB
locally.
mongosh – the MongoDB Shell. It’s the command-line interface for
interacting with MongoDB. You use it to run commands, queries, and scripts.
MongoDB Compass – a GUI tool for visualizing data, running queries, and
analyzing performance. Perfect for beginners who prefer a graphical view.
- by default runs at 27017 port

- a database can have multiple collections and a collection can have multiple documents which have json like data. 



Mongodb Shell:

1) use databasename; : for switching to a db
2) show dbs; : for showing available databases
3) show collections : for showing available collections
4) db.mycollection.insertOne({key : value, key : value}) : for inserting document in the collection (automatically gives object an id)
5) cls : clearing command shell
6) db.mycollection.insertMany([{key: value,key:value},{key:value,key: value}]) : inserting multiple documents at once in db

Aggregation Pipeline:

-Aggregation pipelines in MongoDB are used to analyze and transform data. They
work in stages: each stage performs an operation, and the output of one stage
becomes the input of the next

 MongoDB Indexes:

-Indexes in MongoDB are special data structures that improve the speed of read
operations on a collection. They work similarly to indexes in books, allowing the
database to quickly locate and access the data without scanning every document.
